# Formalization status

This file is the live map from the mathematical proof plan to Lean.
A statement is called **Formalized** only after the corresponding declaration
is on `main` and GitHub Actions is green.

**Status meanings**

- **API formalized** — definitions compile and are used by later files.
- **Formalized** — theorem and proof are checked by Lean on green `main`.
- **Current target** — active work frontier.
- **Planned** — intentionally not opened yet.

| Mathematical item / gate | Lean declaration / file | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository / CI bootstrap | `PSTSEPPA.lean`, `.github/workflows/lean.yml` | **Formalized** | Lean/mathlib 4.34.1; full build and axiom audit are green. |
| T0: PSTS basic API | `PSTSEPPA/PSTS/Basic.lean` | **API formalized** | `Option`-valued partial operation; diagonal is total; symmetry plus one companion identity, with the other derived. |
| T0: closed subsets / induced systems | `PSTSEPPA/PSTS/Closed.lean` | **API formalized** | Closed sets are closed under defined operation values; restriction to a closed subtype is a PSTS. |
| T0: partial automorphisms | `PSTSEPPA/PSTS/PartialAut.lean` | **API formalized** | Uses option-valued `PEquiv`; source/target are closed; inverse and composition are checked. Composition means first `p`, then `q`, matching `PEquiv.trans`. |
| T0: regression examples | `PSTSEPPA/PSTS/Examples.lean` | **Formalized** | Discrete systems on 0/1/2 points, one Steiner triple, a non-closed two-point subset, and a genuinely partial singleton automorphism. |\n| T1: signed words and partial evaluation | `PSTSEPPA/PSTS/WordEval.lean` | **Current target** | Audit composition/action orientation carefully. |
| T2: abstract MAX interface | `PSTSEPPA/PSTS/MaxTransporter.lean` | Planned | State only what the quotient development needs. |
| T2: quotient development | `PSTSEPPA/PSTS/Development.lean` | Planned | Equality criterion, injective base copy, functionality, closedness, group action. |
| T2: conditional EPPA transfer | `PSTSEPPA/PSTS/EPPAFromMax.lean` | Planned | **Hard gate before ABO Sections 3–5.** |
| A1: oriented labelled graphs / transition groups | `PSTSEPPA/ABO/...` | Planned | Custom graph API likely preferable to `SimpleGraph`. |
| A2: clusters / coset extensions | `PSTSEPPA/ABO/...` | Planned | Include degenerate/equal-parameter cases explicitly. |
| A3: corrected ABO Theorem 4.7 | `PSTSEPPA/ABO/UpwardInduction.lean` | Planned | Incorporate repairs R1, R7, R8. Highest-risk gate. |
| A4: corrected Section 5 induction | `PSTSEPPA/ABO/FiniteConstruction.lean` | Planned | Separate repaired `k = 1` base case R2. |
| A5: corrected ABO Lemma 2.5 | `PSTSEPPA/ABO/MainLemma.lean` | Planned | Include final-group equality and equivariance. |
| C1: Cayley / semidirect-product bridge | `PSTSEPPA/ABO/CayleyApplication.lean`, `PSTSEPPA/ABO/MaxTransporter.lean` | Planned | Derive the concrete fibre-MAX property. |
| FINAL: unconditional PSTS-EPPA | `PSTSEPPA/PSTS/EPPA.lean` | Planned | Instantiate T2 with C1. |

## Gate discipline

Do not begin the long ABO construction merely because its definitions are
available. The first major milestone is a compiled conditional theorem of the
form

```text
finite PSTS A + finite selected partial automorphisms + MAX extension
    => finite PSTS witness extending the selected maps.
```

If that transfer layer does not compile cleanly, repair it or use the documented
fallback ladder before investing in ABO Sections 3–5.


### Gate T0 design note

The PSTS API deliberately uses a partial binary operation
`op : V → V → Option V` rather than a ternary relation.  Diagonal values are
total (`op x x = some x`).  Symmetry and one Steiner companion identity are
stored; the second companion identity is derived.  This keeps the structure
nonredundant while making closure under the partial operation literal.

Partial automorphisms are built on mathlib's option-valued `PEquiv`.  The
operation-isomorphism condition is a single `Option.bind` equality, so it
simultaneously preserves and reflects definedness.  Their domains and ranges
are required to be closed.  Inversion, closed preimages and composition are
proved in Lean; the composition convention is the one used by
`PEquiv.trans`: first the left map, then the right map.  This convention is
the one to be used by the signed-word layer.
